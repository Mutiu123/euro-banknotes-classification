## Project Description:
In this project, I aim to create an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying different denominations of Euro banknotes. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, we can automate the process of identifying and categorizing banknotes, which has practical applications in various domains.

## Applications:
The applications of this project are vast and impactful. Here are a few key ones:
1. **Automated Cash Handling Systems**:
   - Banks, ATMs, and retail businesses deal with large volumes of cash transactions daily. An automated system that can swiftly and accurately classify banknotes ensures efficient cash management.
   - The model can be integrated into ATMs, cash registers, and self-service kiosks to verify deposited notes and dispense the correct change.

2. **Currency Sorting and Authentication**:
   - Central banks and currency processing centers need to sort and authenticate banknotes. Our model can assist in this process by identifying counterfeit notes or damaged ones.
   - It contributes to maintaining the integrity of the currency supply chain.

3. **Financial Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**:
   - Financial institutions are required to monitor transactions for suspicious activity. Detecting counterfeit or altered banknotes is crucial for AML compliance.
   - Our system can flag potentially fraudulent transactions involving counterfeit notes.

4. **Accessibility for Visually Impaired Individuals**:
   - An app or device equipped with our model can assist visually impaired users in identifying banknotes.
   - By capturing an image of a banknote, the system can provide an auditory or tactile output indicating the denomination.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - A diverse dataset of Euro banknote images were gathered. Each note  labeled with its corresponding denomination 5 EUR, 10 EUR, 20 EUR, 50 EUR, 100 EUR, 200 EUR and 500 EUR).
   - Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them to enhance model robustness.

2. **Transfer Learning with Pretrained CNNs**:
   - A pretrained CNN (in this case Resnet18) was utilize as the backbone of our model.
   - Remove the final classification layer and replace it with a custom output layer specific to Euro banknote classes.
   - Fine-tune the network on our dataset to adapt it to the task.

3. **Training and Validation**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train the model using transfer learning, adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
   - Monitor validation accuracy and loss to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation and Testing**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Conduct real-world testing by capturing banknote images and assessing the model's predictions.

5. **Deployment and Integration**:
   - Deploy the trained model as an API or embed it in an application.
   - Integrate it into relevant systems (ATMs, cash registers, mobile apps) for practical use.
